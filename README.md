# Preamp Power Supply

This is a PCB design for an analogue preamplifier power supply

## Inputs

Power can be provided as one of:
* high voltage (240V) AC, relay-switched
* high voltage (240V) AC, unswitched,
* low voltage (12+12V) AC

AC power is switched in accordance with an opto-isolated 12V-remote signal.

## Outputs

The circuit provides:
* +/-12VDC, linear regulated
* 12VDC from always-on switchmode brick, for control circuits
* (un)muting relay output

Very drafty.
