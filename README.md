# Preamp Power Supply

This is a PCB design for an analogue preamplifier power supply

## Inputs

Power can be provided as one of:
* high voltage (240V) AC, relay-switched
* high voltage (240V) AC, unswitched,
* low voltage (12+12V) AC

## Outputs

The circuit provides:
* 12VDC, linear regulated
* -12VDC, linear regulated
* 12VDC, from always-on switchmode brick
* TBC: muting output per ESP

Very drafty.
